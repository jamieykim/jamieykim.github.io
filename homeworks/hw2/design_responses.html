					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that some websites use specific padding rules of different pixel multiples to bring visual consistency amongst the interface. I also learned that white space on a website is not wasted space. Not everything has to be filled and it actually intentionally helps with the user's experience in terms of what elements to focus on as well as read the page accordingly. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Much like in real life, it is easier to navigate where you are going and what to look at when things are less crowded and things are grouped together by function. Similarly, white space can separate functions, visual elements, information, and other content so that the user can comfortably navigate the page. It can also point users on where to focus on whether that is functionally or commercially. </p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
