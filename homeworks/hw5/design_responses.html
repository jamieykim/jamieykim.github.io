                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> There are many different ways in which users can interact with interfaces in terms of animation of text and graphics. This helps guide the eyes of the user toward important content, while providing a smooth transition between information. Animation can also better help visualize the functions and purpose of the interface itself. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was seeing the creativity and idversity in animation and movement when it came to different mobile and web interfaces. Some came across as minimal and functional, while others provided a more artistic approach. Some were heavily content-based while others were graphic-focused.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really liked the Selected Work Transitions as it made a simple magazine website turn into an even more immersive experience. It made interacting with the images just a little more engaging for the user. Another one I found cool in functionality was the Nike Add to Cart feature and moved between different panels of the interface. It visually showed the availaibility in style. color, and size of shoe as you were interacting, making for an interactive shopping experience online.</p>

                            <p> I would rate it an 8 as it provided direct examples of creativity across a wide variety of interfaces that can prove as inspiration for new ideas I can develop. </p>
