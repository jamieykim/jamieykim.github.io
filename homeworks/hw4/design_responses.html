						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The need for color accessiblity among product and web design is high as 217 million people live with visual impairments. It is important to create visual experiences that include these people in order to have accessibility to the web. This issue surrounding visual accessibility is so large that federal lawsuits have been made by organizations against inaccessible websites in order to create more accessible standards. I didn't realize that color could create such differences in user experience on an accessibility and inclusivity scale. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> There are many ways to ensure color accessibility. This includes adjusting levels of contrast in color or colors used. The article makes a good point of not relying only on text and color to indicate functions of a website by including symbols/icons. Certain colors are more accessible than others, like when you take red-green color-blindness into consideration.  </p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
