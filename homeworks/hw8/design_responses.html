						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Dark patterns are deliberate designs used to psychologically influence users without keeping their interest in mind. Examples include Bait and Switch, Disguised Ads, Forced Continuity, Friend Spam, Hidden Costs, Misdirection, Price Comparison Prevention, Privacy Zuckering, Roach Motel, Sneak Into Basket, and Trick Questions. Dark patterns have been around for a while and were once obvious and annoying. However, now with the the increasing stealth of such tricks and algorithms, the only solution we are left with as UI/UX designers is to be ethical with the influence our designs have on users.</p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Disguised ads and download buttons are something I am familiar with when utlizing free converter websites that have led to potential virus exposure on my laptop. Another example I have fallen victim to is forced continuity where the idea of a free trial is nice until you forget to forfeit the trial before being charged. Friend spam is one that is consistently annoying where I have tried to clean up my email inbox by unsubscribing from promotional and communicative subscriptions yet there are ways to make it very difficult to find or execute as well as other ways the company tries to contact you. </p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> " Find a way to help the vulnerable around you. If you have privilege, use it for good." </p>
