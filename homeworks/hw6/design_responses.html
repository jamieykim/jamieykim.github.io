					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Duration and speed of animation must be slow enough for user's to navigate and process what is happening as well as quick enough to be efficient. Sizing and the energy of collision must also be taken into account. Movement of objects should be clear and sharp as well. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked getting into the details on easing in animation. To make things life-like, acceleration and deceleration must be involved. The different options include linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 7, I liked how the article went into the user experience rationale behind the animation elements we learned in the programming section. It broke down not only what certain features do but how they affect the user's ability to read and interact with an interface effectively. </p>
